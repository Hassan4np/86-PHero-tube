            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">Var ,let and const</h1>
            <P><span class="text-3xl font-bold">var</span> (Function-scoped): Variables declared with var are function-scoped. This means they are only accessible within the function where they are declared. If a var variable is declared outside of any function,
                it becomes globally scoped. var variables are hoisted, which means the declaration is moved to the top of its containing function or script, but the initialization (assignment) remains in place</P>
            <p><span class="text-3xl font-bold">let</span>(Block-scoped): Variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block (enclosed by curly braces) where they are declared. let variables are not hoisted, so
                you cannot access them before their declaration. You can reassign values to let variables.</p>
            <p><span class="text-3xl font-bold">const</span> (Block-scoped): Variables declared with const are also block-scoped. const variables must be initialized when declared, and you cannot reassign them to a different value after initialization. However,
                objects and arrays declared with const can have their properties or elements modified, but the variable itself cannot be reassigned. Like let, const variables are not hoisted

            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">null and undefined</h1>
            <p><span class="text-3xl font-bold">undefined</span> Variables that have been declared but have not been assigned a value are automatically assigned the value undefined. Function Return: Functions that do not explicitly return a value return
                undefined by default.Object Properties: When you try to access an object property that does not exist, it returns undefined. Function Parameters: If a function is called with fewer arguments than declared parameters, the missing parameters
                are undefined.
            </p>
            <p><span class="text-3xl font-bold">null</span> is a value that must be assigned explicitly. It is often used to indicate that a variable or object property should have no value or should be empty. Intentional Absence of an Object: You might
                use null to indicate.Checking for Explicit Null: You can use null to check if something has been intentionally set to no value. that an object reference intentionally points to nothing. Resetting Values: You can set a variable or object
                property to null to reset it or remove its value.

            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">Rest Api</h1>
            <p>
                <span class="text-3xl font-bold">Rest Api</span> stands for "Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface." It's a standardized architectural style for designing networked applications, particularly web services, that
                use HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for communication. REST APIs allow different software applications to communicate with each other over the internet by sending and receiving data in a format such as JSON or XML. The term "REST" represents
                a set of architectural principles and constraints that guide how resources (such as data or services) are exposed and accessed on the web. These principles promote simplicity, scalability, and statelessness in web service design. Key characteristics
                of REST APIs include statelessness, a uniform interface using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, resource-based identification using URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), and the use of representations (such as JSON
                or XML) to convey data.</p>
